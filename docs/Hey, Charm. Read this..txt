You and the other guy have a lot of things to learn about music theory. :))
(Tell him to read this and study too.)
Luckily, there are several places to do so online, so, yay!
A great place to start would have to be musictheory.net
This file will be updated with stuff that you have to learn, so get to it! :)

Read up on:
(For music theory)
- Time signature, Measures, Staff, the basics.
- Notes, Sharps, Flats, Whole Notes, Half notes, Whole steps (or tone), Half steps (or semitone), etc...
- Chords (Major chords, Minor chords, etc...)
- Key (as in "the song is in the KEY of C")
- Scales (Diatonic, Chromatic)
- More scales (Major, Natural minor, Harmonic minor, etc...)
- Modes (Ionian, Aeolian, Phrygian, etc...)
- Chord Progressions
- Cadence

Also, when we say song, it means the whole song. Verses make up a song. Phrases make up a verse. Measures make up a phrase.

-Mark.
